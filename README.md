Implementing an Urgent Incident Notification Workflow for Network Operations

1.The incident notification system ensures that all Priority 1 + urgency 1= (Critical) incidents are immediately escalated to the Networking Operations/Network team. When a new incident is created with Category set to ‘Network’ and Priority set to 1, a custom Flow Designer workflow triggers an automated email notification to be sent to the right team to assigned user, with the help of field like  category, priority, assignment group.
2.Kura Workload 1, lacked proper trigger conditions for network-related incidents.Modified trigger condition in Flow Designer to check: Catagory = Netwok and Networking operation and priority = 1-critical
Category = Network
Priority = 1 - Critical
Verified and updated the “Network Operations/Network” user group to ensure correct recipients.
Configured the email To be sent: Network  group

AI Scenario:
AI agents can intelligently route critical incidents by analyzing engineer expertise, availability, and workload in real time. Instead of static escalation 
rules, AI considers who is online, their historical performance with similar incidents, and current capacity to respond. It adjusts for global time zones, 
ensuring on-duty engineers in appropriate regions are notified immediately. Over time, AI learns from past resolution patterns to improve future decisions, 
reducing delays and SLA breaches. This dynamic, data-driven routing ensures the right engineer gets the alert at the right time—maximizing efficiency, minimizing downtime, 
and improving response to urgent network issues.
